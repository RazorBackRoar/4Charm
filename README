## macOS Installation

### Download

Download the latest `4Charm_X.X.X.dmg` file from the [Releases](https://github.com/RazorBackRoar/4Charm/releases) page.

### Installation Steps

1. **Open the DMG**: Double-click the downloaded `4Charm_X.X.X.dmg` file
2. **Drag to Applications**: Drag the 4Charm app icon to the Applications folder
3. **Eject the DMG**: Right-click the 4Charm volume on your desktop and select "Eject"

### First Launch - Security Override Required

**Why does macOS show a security warning?**

4Charm is signed with a free ad-hoc signature instead of a paid Apple Developer ID certificate ($99/year). This means macOS Gatekeeper will block the app from opening normally on first launch. This is a standard security feature for apps not distributed through the Mac App Store.

**The app is safe to use** - the source code is open and available for review. The security warning appears because the developer chose not to pay for Apple's annual certificate program.

### Method 1: Right-Click to Open (Recommended)

1. Open **Finder** and navigate to your **Applications** folder
2. **Right-click** (or Control-click) on **4Charm.app**
3. Select **Open** from the context menu
4. Click **Open** in the security dialog that appears
5. The app will now launch and remember this choice for future launches

### Method 2: Terminal Command (Advanced)

If the right-click method doesn't work, you can remove the quarantine attribute using Terminal:

```bash
sudo xattr -cr /Applications/4Charm.app
```

After running this command, you can launch 4Charm normally from your Applications folder.

## Usage

1. **Launch 4Charm** from your Applications folder
2. **Enter a 4chan URL** in the input field:
   - Thread: `https://boards.4chan.org/g/thread/12345678`
   - Catalog: `https://boards.4chan.org/g/catalog`
   - Board: `https://boards.4chan.org/g/`
3. **Choose Download Location** (on first download, you'll be prompted to select where to save files)
4. **Click Download** or press Enter
5. **Monitor Progress** in the log window
6. **Find Downloads** in your chosen folder

### Quick Start (TL;DR)

1. Install 4Charm from the DMG and drag it into Applications.
2. Choose or confirm your download directory.
3. Paste up to 10 thread/catalog URLs (one per line) and click **Start Download**.
4. Let the real-time log show progress; WEBM files go into a dedicated subfolder.

## Download Organization

Files are automatically organized in your chosen download folder:

```text
Your Download Folder/
├── board-threadid/
│   ├── image1.jpg
│   ├── image2.png
│   └── WEBM/
│       ├── video1.webm
│       └── video2.webm
└── board-catalog/
    └── ...
```

- **Thread downloads**: Organized by board and thread ID
- **WEBM files**: Automatically placed in a WEBM subfolder
- **Other media**: Kept in the main thread folder

## System Requirements

- **macOS**: 10.13 (High Sierra) or later
- **Disk Space**: 200+ MB for application, plus space for downloads
- **Internet**: Active connection required
- **Python**: Not required (bundled in app)

## Troubleshooting

### "4Charm.app is damaged and can't be opened"

This message appears when macOS blocks the app due to the ad-hoc signature. Use one of the security override methods above.

### "4Charm.app can't be opened because Apple cannot check it for malicious software"

This is the standard Gatekeeper warning. Right-click the app and select "Open" to bypass this check.

### App won't launch after security override

Try removing the quarantine attribute:

```bash
sudo xattr -cr /Applications/4Charm.app
```

### Downloads fail or are very slow

- Check your internet connection
- 4chan may be rate-limiting requests - the app will automatically slow down
- Try downloading fewer threads at once

### "No media files found"

- Verify the URL is correct and the thread still exists
- Some threads may not contain any media files
- The thread may have been archived or deleted
